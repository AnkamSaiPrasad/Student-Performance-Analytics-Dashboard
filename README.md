# Student-Performance-Analytics-Dashboard
This Project is Focused on analyzing Students Performance based on their marks and attendance.
This also provides a comprehensive analysis and visualization of student performance using both **Python** and **Power BI**. It includes statistical insights, correlation analysis, and an **interactive dashboard** to identify top-performing and struggling students.

## Project Contents
- `Sourcecode.ipynb`: Python notebook for data preprocessing, analysis, and basic visualization.
- `student_data.csv`: The dataset containing student academic and behavioral attributes.
- `Student Performance Dashboard.pbix`: A Power BI dashboard visualizing insights interactively.
- `Output_Screenshots.pdf`: Contains output visuals like correlation matrix, performance comparisons, and dashboard views.

## Objectives
- Analyze key factors affecting student performance.
- Identify top and struggling students.
- Visualize relationships between attendance, average marks, and other variables.
- Present insights using an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## Tools & Technologies
- `Python`, `Jupyter Notebook` : Data preprocessing and exploration
- `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` : For data analysis and visualization
- `Power BI` : For interactive dashboard creation

## Key Visualizations
- Correlation matrix of performance-related factors
- Attendance vs. Average Marks plot
- Top vs. Struggling Students overview
- Student Performance Dashboard (`Power BI`)

## How to Run

## Using Python
1. Clone the repository:
   
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-performance-dashboard.git cd student-performance-dashboard`
   #### If the above command didn't work
   you can also do this by placing the `Sourcecode.ipynb` and `student_data.csv` in same folder.
   
3. Install required packages:
  
   `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter`
  
3. Launch the notebook:

   `jupyter notebook Sourcecode.ipynb`
  
4. Run each cell to see the model training and forecasting in action.

## Using POwer BI
1. Open `Student Performance Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
2. Refresh the data if needed using `student_data.csv`.
