# Student-Performance-Analytics-Dashboard
This Project is Focused on analyzing Students Performance based on their marks and attendance.
This also provides a comprehensive analysis and visualization of student performance using both Python and Power BI. It includes statistical insights, correlation analysis, and an interactive dashboard to identify top-performing and struggling students.

## Project Contents
- `Sourcecode.ipynb`: Python notebook for data preprocessing, analysis, and basic visualization.
- `student_data.csv`: The dataset containing student academic and behavioral attributes.
- `Student Performance Dashboard.pbix`: A Power BI dashboard visualizing insights interactively.
- `Output_Screenshots.pdf`: Contains output visuals like correlation matrix, performance comparisons, and dashboard views.

## Objectives
- Analyze key factors affecting student performance.
- Identify top and struggling students.
- Visualize relationships between attendance, average marks, and other variables.
- Present insights using an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## Tools & Technologies
- `Python`, `Jupyter Notebook` : Data preprocessing and exploration
- `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` : For data analysis and visualization
- `Power BI` : For interactive dashboard creation

## Key Visualizations
